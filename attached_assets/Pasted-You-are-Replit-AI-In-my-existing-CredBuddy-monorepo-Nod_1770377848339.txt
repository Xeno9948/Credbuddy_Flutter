You are Replit AI. In my existing CredBuddy monorepo (Node.js + TypeScript, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL; WhatsApp assistant + lender portal), implement BOTH:

(2) Rewrite ALL existing copy across portal, assistant WhatsApp messages, PDFs, and public pages to follow “CredBuddy = DATA TOOL (decision-support only)” positioning.
(3) Audit and harden ALL LLM prompts to be FAIS-safe (no advice/recommendations/decisions), including adding guardrails and a prohibited-terms filter.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
CredBuddy must be unambiguously a credit DATA/INSIGHT tool:
- We DO NOT provide financial advice
- We DO NOT approve/decline
- We DO NOT recommend actions
- We provide descriptive risk indicators, scores, confidence, and data coverage only
This must be reflected in UI text, WhatsApp responses, PDF language, API responses, and any LLM prompts.

SCOPE A — COPY REWRITE (EVERYWHERE)
1) Find and replace ALL occurrences (code + templates) of lending/decision language, including but not limited to:
   - “approve”, “decline”, “reject”, “accept”, “eligible”, “recommend”, “advice”, “should”, “must”, “proceed”, “do not proceed”, “safe/unsafe”, “good/bad borrower”, “creditworthy”, “unaffordable”.
2) Replace with permitted descriptive language:
   - “indicates”, “shows”, “highlights”, “reflects”, “based on observed data”, “risk indicators”, “trend”, “signal”, “confidence”, “data coverage”, “decision-support only”, “final decision remains with you”.
3) Apply across:
   - /apps/assistant (WhatsApp onboarding, STATUS, risk messages, scenario responses, help text)
   - /apps/portal (all UI labels, buttons, banners, applicant pages, tables)
   - PDF templates (credit report)
   - public pages: /pricing, /terms, landing pages (if present)
   - API response fields (rename any “decision” or “recommendation” keys to neutral equivalents like “risk_band”, “risk_indicators”, “assessment_summary”)
4) Add a persistent disclaimer banner/footer in:
   - Portal applicant detail pages
   - Share pages (/share/:token)
   - PDFs
   - WhatsApp messages when showing assessment results
Short disclaimer (UI/WhatsApp):
   “Decision-support only. Final decisions remain with you.”
Full disclaimer (PDF/Terms):
   “CredBuddy provides data-driven credit risk insights for informational purposes only. CredBuddy does not provide financial advice, credit decisions, or recommendations. The final decision remains entirely with the user or lender.”

SCOPE B — LLM PROMPTS HARDENING (FAIS-SAFE)
1) Create a centralized prompt module in /packages/shared/llm/
   - systemPrompts.ts (FAIS-safe base system prompt)
   - prohibitedTerms.ts (list of forbidden words/phrases)
   - sanitizeOutput.ts (post-check that blocks or rewrites forbidden language)
   - buildPrompt.ts (helper to build prompts with consistent structure)
2) Base system prompt MUST include:
   “You provide descriptive, informational insights only.
    You do not provide advice, recommendations, or decisions.
    Use neutral language.
    Avoid prescriptive terms such as ‘should’, ‘recommend’, ‘approve’, ‘decline’.
    Always state that this output is decision-support only.”
3) Enforce “deterministic facts only” rule:
   - LLM may ONLY rephrase and structure explanations from given JSON inputs (score, band, confidence, flags, features, data coverage).
   - LLM must not introduce new facts, numbers, or suggestions.
4) Add prohibited-terms filter:
   - After LLM output, scan for forbidden terms (case-insensitive, includes variants).
   - If found: either
     a) automatically rewrite using neutral alternatives (preferred), OR
     b) fall back to deterministic template text (safe fallback)
5) Apply the hardened prompts to every LLM use:
   - Explainable AI wording (entrepreneur + lender)
   - Risk warning messages
   - Scenario explanation wording (NOTE: do NOT suggest taking a loan; only simulate “what-if” and end with “final decision remains with you”)
   - Any translation/polishing features
6) Add unit tests:
   - Test that forbidden terms are not present in outputs
   - Test fallback works when forbidden terms appear
   - Test system prompt is always used

SCOPE C — UI/UX TEXT RULES (ENFORCE)
1) Remove any “Approve/Decline” actions in portal if still present; ensure actions are:
   - Download Credit Report (PDF)
   - Request updated assessment
   - Share secure link
2) Replace “Band A = safe / Band D = unsafe” type labels with neutral descriptors like:
   - “Band A: lower risk indicators”
   - “Band D: higher risk indicators”
Avoid absolute claims.

DELIVERABLES
- Codebase updated with consistent, FAIS-safe copy across assistant + portal + PDFs + public pages
- Centralized LLM prompt guardrails + prohibited terms filter + safe fallback
- Tests added and passing
- README section: “CredBuddy Positioning: Data tool (Decision-support only)”

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Prefer a single source of truth for disclaimers (shared constants)
- Keep changes backwards compatible where possible, but do rename dangerous response keys if needed
- If you find ambiguous text, rewrite it to be descriptive and neutral
- Do a final grep search in repo for forbidden words and eliminate them from user-facing outputs
